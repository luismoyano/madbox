# The time it took you to perform the exercise

Around 5 hours

# The parts that were difficult for you and why

Dealing with the rigidbody has proven difficult to me.

# The parts you think you could do better and how

Resetting the player and the checkpoints system, other than that I'm very proud with the movement and the camera system.

# What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

Adding some UI, a multiplayer system, some rewards and make it so developing new levels is easier, it requires a reasonable amount of manual setup and some time to put things working.

# What did you think

It was very fun.

# Any comment you may have

I put a lot of effort and I'm proud of the results. Hope you appreciate it and you have my word I'll put my 120% on everything I'll do if you decide to give me a chance.
